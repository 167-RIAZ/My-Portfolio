                    <p className="text-xs xs:text-sm sm:text-base">Hello there! I&apos;m <span className="text-indigo-500 font-semibold">Boluwatife David</span>, a Full-Stack Developer who took a detour from counting populations to coding them (well, sort of). My background in demography surprisingly prepped me for the analytical side of software development. Now, I wield React, Next.js, Node.js, and dabble in PHP and Python to build web apps that are both functional and, dare I say, a little bit fun. I started my journey as a Frontend Developer and, like a curious explorer, gathered enough skills to become a <span className="text-violet-600">Fullstack Developer</span>.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h2 className="text-md sm:text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-500">How I got here</h2>
                    <p className="text-xs xs:text-sm sm:text-base">My self-taught coding journey led me to land my first freelance gig in record time (11 months, to be exact!). That opened the door to an internship at <span className="text-violet-600">Swap Space</span> where I polished my skills to a fine shine. And then a contract role at <span className="text-violet-400 font-semibold">Adroit Handyman Services</span>, where I gave their website a much-needed facelift â€“ we&apos;re talking a 30% boost in server response time and 20% more user engagement. Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h2 className="text-md sm:text-2xl font-bold text-violet-400">Where I&apos;m looking to go next</h2>
                    <p className="text-xs xs:text-sm sm:text-base">Now, I&apos;m absolutely thrilled about the advancements in <span className="text-indigo-500 font-semibold">AI</span> and how it can enhance human work and productivity (without, you know, replacing us). Imagine a world where AI handles the boring bits, leaving us humans to do the creative, fun stuff. That&apos;s the <span className="text-violet-600 font-semibold">future</span> I&apos;m excited about! I&apos;m on the lookout for opportunities where I can blend my tech skills and AI enthusiasm to create something amazing. So, if you have a vision that needs a dash of innovation and a sprinkle of humor, let&apos;s connect and make magic happen!</p>
